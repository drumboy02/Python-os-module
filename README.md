# The os module

This is my script for 4.4 Section 4 - The os module - interacting with the
operating system of the Cisco NetAcad Python Essentials 2 course.

os_module.py contains a find_dir() function that accepts path and target_dir
arguments. The function recursively searches the given path for subdirectories
that match the target_dir and prints them to the terminal.
